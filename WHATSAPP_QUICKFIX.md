# ⚠️ QUICK FIX: WhatsApp "Unable to create record" Error

## The Problem
```
Failed to send WhatsApp message: [HTTP 400] Unable to create record: 
Twilio could not find a Channel with the specified From address
```

## The Solution (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Get Your EXACT Sandbox Number
1. Go to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/sms/try-it-out/whatsapp-learn
2. Look for **"Twilio Sandbox Number"**
3. Copy it EXACTLY (e.g., `+14155238886`)

### Step 2: Update Your `.env` File
```env
TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM=whatsapp:+14155238886
```
⚠️ **Important**: 
- Must start with `whatsapp:`
- Must match the sandbox number from Twilio Console EXACTLY
- No spaces, no extra characters

### Step 3: Clear Config Cache & Restart
```powershell
php artisan config:clear
php artisan serve
```

## Test It
1. Make sure YOUR phone number joined the sandbox (send join code via WhatsApp)
2. Send a test message to YOUR phone number
3. Should work now! ✅

## Still Not Working?

**See the complete guide**: [WHATSAPP_SETUP.md](WHATSAPP_SETUP.md)

### Quick Checks:
- ✓ Sandbox number in `.env` matches Twilio Console?
- ✓ Your phone joined the sandbox (sent the join code)?
- ✓ Cleared config cache?
- ✓ Restarted server?
- ✓ Testing with the phone that joined?

---

**Most Common Mistake**: Using `whatsapp:+14155238886` when your actual sandbox number is different!
